# Lunaria: your journal in the stars âœ¨

Lunaria is a desktop app that lets you write and save journal entries. It's inspired by the plant Lunaria, also known as the money plant, which is associated with honesty, as well as with the moon because of its silver color. Fitting the name, the structure is around the lunar cycle, instead of around the normal calendar. This means you can see your entries in the context of the moon's phases!

To make Lunaria, I used:
- Electron for the desktop app
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Why Lunaria?
I like the moon, I would like to get into writing. Then this awesome YSWS (shoutout Rewind) dropped, and I wanted to make a desktop app. Viola, Lunaria!


## Struggles, and struggles, and learning
One of the biggest things for me was getting the app to feel as mystical as I wanted it to feel. I played with color schemes until I found one I liked, and I think purple and gold (what I eventually landed on) is exactly my vibe. That being said, it wasn't always easy. Making the moon circle took ages, as did aligning the mini moons around them when clicked. I learned a lot about JS functions, animations with CSS, and so much more. Another thing was, I hadn't added my gitignore when I tried to commit, so when I tried to I got an error that my file was too big. Eventually, I just had to clear my past commit history and start fresh. But hey, I won't forget to add .gitignore again ðŸ˜…

All in all, this was a fun project, and I definitely want to expand more on this in the future!
