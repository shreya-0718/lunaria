# Lunaria: your journal in the stars âœ¨

Lunaria is a desktop app that lets you write and save journal entries. It's inspired by the plant Lunaria, also known as the money plant, which is associated with honesty, as well as with the moon because of its silver color. Fitting the name, the structure is around the lunar cycle, instead of around the normal calendar. This means you can see your entries in the context of the moon's phases, and you can also view your entries for past lunar cycles!

To make Lunaria, I used:
- Electron for the desktop app
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend 
- Node.js for the backend
